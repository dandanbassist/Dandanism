Dandanism: the doctrine of empathy to everyone — including yourself.

## Manifesto (example)

Dandanism is a practice and philosophy centered on extending empathy and kindness outward — and inward. It encourages:
- Listening to others without judgment.
- Treating yourself with the same care you offer a friend.
- Small daily practices that build compassion (check-ins, active listening, and gentle self-reflection).

If you'd like, I can expand this into a longer manifesto, add a website skeleton, or include usage examples and contribution guidelines.
